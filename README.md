# PowerShellGuard
A [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) implementation for PowerShell, which allows for Pester tests to automatically be run whenever you make changes to a file.

## Why PowerShellGuard?

### Streamlined workflow.
In conemu, I can dedicate a portion of my console window to just run tests.  Using PowerShellGuard, I can watch my source code and trigger test runs of as much of my test harness as I want.  This gives me fast feedback with minimal effort, making sure any changes that break existing behavior are noticed near when the changes are made.

# Examples:

```powershell
New-Guard -wait
```
Watch the files in the current directory for changes and run Pester on any changes.

```powershell
New-Guard -Path .\lib\chef\knife\ -PathFilter '*.rb' -Recurse -TestCommand rspec -TestPath .\spec\unit\knife\
Wait-Guard
```
Watch all .rb files under .\lib\chef\knife and when they change, run the unit tests using RSpec.

```powershell
dir *.ps1 | New-Guard -TestPath {"./Tests/$($_.basename).Tests.ps1"} -wait
```
Enumerate a directory and set up a test runner for each ps1 file based on its file name.  For example hello.ps1 would have the test ./Tests/hello.Tests.ps1

## Installing PowerShellGuard

You can install PowerShellGuard via PowerShellGet from the PowerShellGallery.

```powershell
Install-Module PowerShellGuard
```

If you want the development feed (built from master),

```powershell
Register-PSRepository -Name PowerShellGuard_current -SourceLocation 'https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/PowerShellGuard/'
```

```powershell
Install-Module PowerShellGuard -Source PowerShellGuard_current
```
